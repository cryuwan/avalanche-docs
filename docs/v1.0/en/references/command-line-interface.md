`--api-auth-password` (string):

The password needed to create/revoke authorization tokens. If `--api-auth-required=true`, must be specified; otherwise ignored. See [here](../api/auth.md) for more information.

`--api-health-enabled` (boolean):

If set to `true`, this node will expose the Health API. Defaults to `true`.

`--api-info-enabled` (boolean):

If set to `false`, this node will not expose the Keystore API. Defaults to `true`.

`--api-metrics-enabled` (boolean):

If set to `false`, this node will not expose the Metrics API. Defaults to `true`.

`--assertions-enabled` (boolean):

When set to `true`, assertions will execute at runtime throughout the codebase. This is intended for use in debugging, as we may get a more specific error message. Defaults to `true`.

`--bootstrap-ids` (string):

Bootstrap IDs is an array of validator IDs. These IDs will be used to authenticate bootstrapping peers. This only needs to be set when `--p2p-tls-enabled=true`. An example setting of this field would be `--bootstrap-ids="NodeID-7Xhw2mDxuDS44j42TCB6U5579esbSt3Lg,NodeID-MFrZFVCXPv5iCn6M9K6XduxGTYp891xXZ"`. The default value is the empty set.

`--bootstrap-ips` (string):

Bootstrap IPs is an array of IPv4:port pairs. These IP Addresses will be used to bootstrap the current Avalanche state. An example setting of this field would be `--bootstrap-ips="127.0.0.1:12345,1.2.3.4:5678"`. The default value is the empty set.

`--conn-meter-max-conns` (int):

Upgrade at most `conn-meter-max-conns` connections from a given IP per `conn-meter-reset-duration`.
If `conn-meter-reset-duration` is 0, incoming connections are not rate-limited.

`--conn-meter-reset-duration` (duration):
 
Upgrade at most `conn-meter-max-conns` connections from a given IP per `conn-meter-reset-duration`.
If `conn-meter-reset-duration` is 0, incoming connections are not rate-limited.

Specifies the directory to which the database is persisted. Defaults to `"$HOME/.avalanchego/db"`.

`--db-enabled` (boolean):

If set to `false`, state updates are performed solely to an in-memory database, without making any changes on permanent storage. When set to `true`, state updates are written to a local persistent database. Defaults to `true`.

`--http-host` (string):

The address that HTTP APIs listen on. The default value is `127.0.0.1`. This means that by default, your node can only handle API calls made from the same machine. To allow API calls from other machines, do `--http-host=`. For example if your public IP address is `1.2.3.4` and you'd like to access AvalancheGo's RPC over that IP address then you need to pass in `--http-host=1.2.3.4`.

`--http-port` (int):

Each node runs an HTTP server that provides the APIs for interacting with the node and the Avalanche network. This argument specifies the port that the HTTP server will listen on. The default value is `9650`.

`--http-tls-cert-file` (string, file path):

This argument specifies the location of the TLS certificate used by the node for the HTTPS server. This must be specified when `--http-tls-enabled=true`. There is no default value.

`--http-tls-enabled` (boolean):

If set to `true`, this flag will attempt to upgrade the server to use HTTPS. Defaults to `false`.

`--http-tls-key-file` (string, file path):

This argument specifies the location of the TLS private key used by the node for the HTTPS server. This must be specified when `--http-tls-enabled=true`. There is no default value.

`--ipcs-chain-ids` (string)

Attempts to raise the process file descriptor limit to at least this value. Defaults to `32768`

`--log-level` (string, `{Off, Fatal, Error, Warn, Info, Debug, Verbo}`):

The log level determines which events to log. There are 7 different levels, in order from highest priority to lowest.

* `Off`: No logs have this level of logging.
* `Fatal`: Fatal errors that are not recoverable.
* `Error`: Errors that the node encounters, these errors were able to be recovered.
* `Warn`: A Warning that might be indicative of a spurious byzantine node, or potential future error.
* `Info`: Useful descriptions of node status updates.
* `Debug`: Debug logging is useful when attempting to understand possible bugs in the code. More information that would be typically desired for normal usage will be displayed.
* `Verbo`: Tracks extensive amounts of information the node is processing. This includes message contents and binary dumps of data for extremely low level protocol analysis.

When specifying a log level note that all logs with the specified priority or higher will be tracked. Defaults to `Info`.

`--log-display-level` (string, `{Off, Fatal, Error, Warn, Info, Debug, Verbo}`):

The log level determines which events to display to the screen. If left blank, will default to the value provided to `--log-level`.

`--network-id` (string):

The identity of the network the node should connect to. Can be one of:

* `--network-id=fuji` -> Connect to the Fuji test-network. This aliases `network-5`.
* `--network-id=testnet` -> Connect to the current test-network. (Right now, this is Fuji.)
* `--network-id=local` -> Connect to a local test-network. This aliases `network-12345`.
* `--network-id=network-{id}` -> Connect to the `id` network. `id` must be in the range `[0, 2^32)`.

`--network-id` defaults to `fuji`.

`--public-ip` (string):

Validators must know their public facing IP addresses so they can let other nodes know how to connect to them. If this argument is not provided, the node will attempt to perform NAT traversal to get the node's public IP. Should be set to `127.0.0.1` to create a local network. The default value is `""`.

`--dynamic-public-ip` (string):

Valid values if param is present: `ifconfig` or `opendns`.
This overrides `--public-ip`, will poll the remote service every `--dynamic-update-duration` and update the nodes public IP address.

`--dynamic-update-duration` (duration):

The port through which the staking server will connect to the Avalanche network externally. Defaults to `9651`.

`--p2p-tls-enabled` (boolean):

Avalanche uses two-way authenticated TLS connections to securely identify the `stakingID` of connected peers. However, This can be disabled for testing. When TLS is disabled, the `stakingID` will be derived from the IP Address the node claims it owns. This will also disable encryption of inter-node communication. This should only be specified for testing. Defaults to `true`. This must be true when `--staking-enabled=true`.

`--staking-enabled` (boolean):

Avalanche uses Proof of Stake (PoS) as Sybil resistance to make it prohibitively expensive to attack the network. When this is `true`, `--p2p-tls-enabled` must be set to `true` in order to secure P2P communications.

`--staking-tls-cert-file` (string, file path):

Avalanche uses two-way authenticated TLS connections to securely identify the `stakingID` of connected peers when `--p2p-tls-enabled=true`. This argument specifies the location of the TLS certificate used by the node. This must be specified when `--p2p-tls-enabled=true`. The default value is `""`.

`--staking-tls-key-file` (string, file path):

Avalanche uses two-way authenticated TLS connections to securely identify the `stakingID` of connected peers when `--p2p-tls-enabled=true`. This argument specifies the location of the TLS private key used by the node. This must be specified when `--p2p-tls-enabled=true`. The default value is `""`.

`--staking-disabled-weight` (int):
